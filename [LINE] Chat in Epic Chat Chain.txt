05:22 AM	#keepthepooleclean	It's incredible in its own right. I went to the last one at Grace Cathedral. Before dancing commenced, right after meditation, a group of people, including one particularly beautiful woman, sang Like a Prayer in front of the pews.
07:38 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-to-host-news-conference-on-discovery-beyond-our-solar-system
07:39 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Supposedly going to announce some discoveries but I think that's hype. Would be fun to tune in anyway-- 10am PST
10:11 AM	Tommy Kuntze	7 hospital planets in a single system! Amazing find 
10:11 AM	Tommy Kuntze	[Sticker]
10:12 AM	Chom	And only 40ly away! Practically around the block on the galactic scale 
10:12 AM	Samir Awan	Tommy what are the highlights 
10:14 AM	Samir Awan	Or Tom 
10:14 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Found Trappist 1 (a cold dwarf star) from the Chilean observatory in 2016 with 2-3 planets, but found all 7 now, including mass/size estimates and some thoughts around them maybe being tidally-locked like the moon
10:14 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Or Laura... geez. 
10:15 AM	Tommy Kuntze	Haha well summarized laura!
10:15 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	The fact it's so close is amazing!! 
10:16 AM	Tommy Kuntze	So true! Def the coolest piece
10:16 AM	Samir Awan	Laura thank you as well! 
10:16 AM	Tommy Kuntze	Also the star is brightest in infrared light, so now the team knows what tools to use to look closer into it
10:16 AM	Samir Awan	Im just so used to Tom being balls deep in black holes and stars 
10:17 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	And other holes... hehehehheheheh

11:04 AM	Natalie Marcisz	Very cool! (space)
11:42 AM	Ross Wagner	The inner planet orbits Trappist in 1.5 days! The outer one in 20 days... insane! Super compact compared to our system 
12:45 PM	Chris Sevs	"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/22/science/trappist-1-exoplanets-nasa.html

12:46 PM	Chris Sevs	Dwarf star, such tiny orbits
12:46 PM	Chris Sevs	And one might be in the habitable zone with liquid water
02:09 PM	Chom	Liquid water! Let's ship them some tardigrades on a solar sail! 
02:34 PM	Tommy Kuntze	Those little bastards are probably already there
02:40 PM	Chris Sevs	That's a BOLD statement Tommy, the worst part is that it would probably become a political issue
02:41 PM	Tommy Kuntze	They seem like a peaceful species
02:42 PM	Tommy Kuntze	[Sticker]
02:42 PM	Chris Sevs	But god would never create life on another planet, the scientists must be wrong!

07:45 AM	Chris Sevs	Which site? I can try for another cabin once they come online at 8?
07:45 AM	Peter Linnartz	I do!
07:45 AM	Chris Sevs	I'm looking for the weekend of sept 22-24
07:47 AM	Chris Sevs	I've actually got three reservations open for that weekend so when they open at 8, I can hopefully get something
07:49 AM	Chris Sevs	If all of those cabins are sold out and I manage to get something else awesome, would people still be down?
07:50 AM	Samir Awan	Sevs do another weekend 
07:50 AM	Chris Sevs	I have weddings and burning mans the other weekends, maybe last weekend of September?
07:51 AM	Peter Linnartz	Ah yeah can't do that weekend either
07:51 AM	Peter Linnartz	Last weekend is good
07:51 AM	Chris Sevs	Ok I'll look at that one
07:57 AM	Chris Sevs	(four) minutes
08:00 AM	Tommy Kuntze	This sounds amazing...I'm down
08:03 AM	Chris Sevs	Tony you get anything? All booked for me
08:04 AM	Chris Sevs	I mean that they are all booked and I couldn't get a cabin
08:05 AM	Chris Sevs	I did manage to get one site that wasn't reserved yet for that weekend, but it's a doozy and I don't want to reserve if you managed to get a cabin
08:06 AM	Chris Sevs	I've got like 2 minutes to hold and buy the reservation
08:09 AM	Chris Sevs	It's the group site in angel island. We need between 9 and 200 people
08:09 AM	Tommy Kuntze	Sounds easy (up)
08:10 AM	Chris Sevs	Ok I'll get it. Assuming tony couldn't get a cabin given his radio silence?
08:10 AM	Tommy Kuntze	Seems legit
08:10 AM	Samir Awan	We can get 200 people 
08:11 AM	Chris Sevs	Ok I got the sunrise group site
08:11 AM	Chris Sevs	September 30
08:12 AM	Chris Sevs	I fucking hate how things get reserved within 10 seconds on that site

07:27 AM	Emily	What's the theme?
07:29 AM	Jordan Schiff	Cinema stuff (extended cinema)
07:31 AM	#patwilliams	I thought it was food?
07:52 AM	#keepthepooleclean	Emily - I just thought the theme was cool science stuff. But cinema and food sound good, too! 
10:15 AM	Sam	I could take them off of your hands Rob. Had been planning to go, actually
10:42 AM	Samir Awan	@Ross Wagner you buy any snap stock ?
11:13 AM	#keepthepooleclean	Sorry Sam. Just sold them to Pat
12:11 PM	Ross Wagner	Yup. 
12:11 PM	Ross Wagner	Happy Snapchat IPO everyone!
12:11 PM	Emily	Ross they really have you in large part to thank for their success 
12:12 PM	Ross Wagner	Lol. I'd love to think so @Emily :)
03:26 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Their eval. seems bloated. Esp since they're losing users to Insta. Guess we'll see what happens!!
03:43 PM	Ross Wagner	We shall see! Their facial recognition technology is state of the art (even though its kind of cheesy), their spectacles have a lot of potential in the extreme sport scene, and the two generations below us use it over Insta or FB. 
03:48 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	And I also recently learned that they're dominating the 45-54 demographic which is awesome/funny! They have some differentiators, just need to keep leading the charge over their competitors and keep innovating. 
03:49 PM	Natalie Marcisz	Haha I can't imagine my mom using Snapchat
03:49 PM	Natalie Marcisz	Ross' dad does tho.... runs in the family

04:14 PM	Samir Awan	Damn Sevs that's who you are dating ?
04:15 PM	Chris Sevs	She's more interested in "Perito"
04:15 PM	Chris Sevs	Which is Spanish for "little Peter" which I think works well on many levels

04:46 PM	Chris Sevs	@Peter Linnartz I just checked sportsbasement. Their skis and rentals are pretty expensive. I might try the demo thing on Friday 
04:48 PM	Peter Linnartz	Ok, I'm on my own
04:57 PM	Ross Wagner	Demo-ing equip is always the best route @Chris Sevs 
04:58 PM	ItsTheRealTony	Just pull the trigger on some fresh planks Linnartz 
04:59 PM	ItsTheRealTony	Go big or go home 
04:59 PM	Chris Sevs	Good deals when you demo?
04:59 PM	Peter Linnartz	I'm doing it, haven't been prepping to make this kind of choice though
04:59 PM	Peter Linnartz	Any advice?
05:03 PM	Ross Wagner	Not sure about deals, but always newer products and less best up equipment. I think it's generally around the same price 
05:03 PM	Ross Wagner	Beat*
05:06 PM	Jordan Schiff	@sevs @Peter Linnartz worth checking out the ski store on Gilman in Berkeley 
07:18 PM	imaniani	Usually when you demo the cost of demoing is taken out of the cost of the skis if you purchase, so demoing a pair you think you're likely to buy is basically free 
08:18 PM	ItsTheRealTony	Guys if you haven't read this yet, this is an awesome article on Drumph in the Washington post. 17 sources including 4 senior aides over the course of a week gave info for the story

Tue, 03/07/2017
08:03 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Oh I've been sending political stuff on here. Whoops. Would you say the article's unbiased/fair/non-partisan?
12:18 PM	Chom	I wouldn't call the Washington Post "unbiased" - they are now what I call a left leaning news outlet. That being said their articles are better written and sourced than most. They have also been accused of leaning conservative in the past decade
01:37 PM	Sam	"Jeff Bezos' purchase of WP has been one the best things to happen in print journalism. 

Agreed that they aren't ""unbiased"", but are very well sourced."
03:42 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	"That's good! We get so much left leaning stuff here in Cali and Bay Area specifically so I'm trying to NOT read liberal stuff too much. Would love more
Conservative-leaning stuff if anyone has it. And always prefer well-sourced stuff over opinion pieces (which it seems everything is these days, even the president's speeches and policies unfortunately...😏)"
04:11 PM	K-Pound	I'm in the same boat Laura, I even read Fox News to know what the other side is thinking/saying

07:34 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	"Cold atom lab" at the ISS to freeze atoms to nearly absolute zero! (cold)
08:00 AM	Chris Sevs	I noticed their little graphic of thermometers doesn't include rankine degrees. How convenient. 
08:00 AM	Chris Sevs	In jet engine design we used exclusively rankine. It was a weird unit to work in
08:02 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Rankine degrees? What's the conversion to other units?
08:03 AM	Samir Awan	Explain more @Chris Sevs 
08:11 AM	Chris Sevs	Rankine is the absolute temperature scale of Fahrenheit units. Similar to kelvin for Celsius. So 0 R = -459.67 degF
08:12 AM	Samir Awan	Ya but why is it significant for thermodynamic calculations?
08:12 AM	Chris Sevs	In thermodynamics and heat transfer you have to work on absolute scale
08:13 AM	#patwilliams	Is 0R = 0K?
08:13 AM	Chris Sevs	Because you'll have equations for energy where you multiply by temp. You need to make sure you have an absolute scale and not a "oh we just made this up because we think water is cool and does stuff"
08:13 AM	Chris Sevs	Yeah
08:13 AM	Chris Sevs	But the units of R are sized to Fahrenheit
08:14 AM	#patwilliams	Because America 
08:14 AM	Chris Sevs	So a change of 40 R is also a change of 40 degF
08:15 AM	Chris Sevs	Yeah the older engineers don't know how to use moon units so we are forced to continue working in lbs, BTUs, Rankine, and psi
08:16 AM	Samir Awan	Got it essentially absolute scale let's you move from a known starting point that is not arbitrary
08:17 AM	Chris Sevs	Yeah exactly
08:17 AM	Chris Sevs	And all of our radiation heat measurements and also color measurements are based on it
08:18 AM	Jordan Schiff	So in absolute scale, my penis is many feet long, but in normal inches, it's only 2.
08:18 AM	Jordan Schiff	Got it, makes me feel a lot better
08:19 AM	Chris Sevs	Yeah we use the scale that makes us feel like we matter
08:19 AM	Jordan Schiff	Hahah
08:20 AM	#patwilliams	That's how I pick my facts
08:21 AM	Samir Awan	http://theoatmeal.com/pl/senior_year/science
08:21 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Just make sure u don't measure size when it's 0 rankine outside. Gotta wait til it's at least like 530 R to get the full effect.
08:23 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	That was @ Jordan
08:23 AM	Chris Sevs	If it's 0 R outside, penis size is the least of your problems
08:24 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Right? Can that be the phrase to mean "it's fucking cold outside"? "Omg it's like 0 R right now!"
08:31 AM	Peter Linnartz	If you weren't going to get laid because if your tiny penis, saying that isn't going to help either
08:34 AM	Chris Sevs	And the fact that all molecules cease movement at absolute zero is going to make it tougher too. Just a lot of things going against you at that point. 
08:37 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	😂 love this morning convo!
08:38 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	For the record, I do think nerdiness can get one laid 😉

09:38 AM	Tommy Kuntze	"CONSULTING
If you're not a part of the solution, there's good money to be made in prolonging the problem."
09:38 AM	Tommy Kuntze	💯 
09:43 AM	Chom	"Marketing:
Because making it look good now is more important than providing adequate support later."
09:43 AM	Théo	Ahh  @Peter Linnartz I'm so jealous 
09:46 AM	Samir Awan	Mistakes : It could be that the purpose of your life is only to serve as a warning to others.

11:14 AM	Ross Wagner	Lol ... Mistakes have been made @Samir Awan 
11:24 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	I like how u highlight the marketing one tom... are u saying something about my craft??
11:25 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Lol jk I agree, that's why I do product marketing, cuz I don't wanna make lemonade out of lemons, I just want to sell lemonade.

12:49 PM	Natalie Marcisz	Submarine named "Boaty McBoatface" 
12:49 PM	Samir Awan	Hahah Sevs favorite sub
12:50 PM	Natalie Marcisz	I feel like sevs would approve of the name
01:30 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Anyone know is Frontier is legit? Buying a flight back east and it's only $113 one way instead of like $250+
01:36 PM	Chris Sevs	Why would we name a sub anything else?!
01:39 PM	Samir Awan	Ya frontier is great 
01:40 PM	Samir Awan	Well better than spirit I think 
01:40 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Alright I'm gonna give it a whirl!
02:42 PM	Tommy Kuntze	Spirit is ranked the worst airline haha
02:42 PM	Samir Awan	Yup so you are alrewdy winning 
02:42 PM	Tommy Kuntze	Frontier is fine - used to be the shit but has gone down since Northwest bought them. Main thing they stopped doing: fresh baked cookies for everyone midflight
02:42 PM	Tommy Kuntze	[Sticker]
02:46 PM	Ross Wagner	The fresh baked cookies were so good!!
02:46 PM	Ross Wagner	RIP nw airlines 
03:23 PM	Natalie Marcisz	Haha wut that cookie idea is the best business strategy I've heard in awhile
03:34 PM	ItsTheRealTony	Dude. Will never fly frontier again. 
03:34 PM	ItsTheRealTony	They charge you for water
03:34 PM	ItsTheRealTony	For WATER
03:39 PM	Natalie Marcisz	^not a good strategy
05:08 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Ya.... I ended up buying the ticket but need to pay $30 to carry on a bag, plus paid $20 to pick seats now. So all in all it was like $180 instead of $120. But that's still better than $250 or whatever for the reg airlines.
05:10 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Those cookies tho! Gah! Although, I'll prolly be stocked with edibles and a ton of other snacks anyway. #bagelbites

09:46 AM	Samir Awan	We should book a cabin for July 4th now 
09:55 AM	Ross Wagner	I'm down @Samir Awan @Tiago Bandeira. We should one day ski, and the other day float the truckee river. My uncle lives along the river and we could probably chill on his lawn and pull up/drink too!

06:54 PM	Natalie Marcisz	I don't have it!
06:55 PM	Emily	Yeahhh the reason that seems too good to be true is that they have just started charging you more for each individual item than it actually costs, and then they've thrown out all of these delivery coupons. Still better than nothing but, frustrating that they're not transparent about it
06:57 PM	K-Pound	But $100 could still go a long way 
06:57 PM	Natalie Marcisz	And get me hooked on being even lazier than I already am haha
09:50 PM	#keepthepooleclean	Natalie - I just learned that when Ross was living at the Flat  and you would sleep over, that you were really annoyed by me playing the same songs over and over, particularly in the morning.

09:36 AM	Peter Linnartz	Not sure what this guys is talking about in this particular case, but I am 100% sure Twitter is not going in and deleting negative tweets about United to protect them
09:36 AM	Jordan Schiff	That United CEO is a twat
09:38 AM	Chom	Hahaha (word)

08:32 AM	Chris Sevs	Daily lotteries are the alternative I guess
08:36 AM	Chris Sevs	July 8 weekend and August 5 weekend are full moons
08:37 AM	Chris Sevs	If anybody is interested in trying our luck with an illegal night summit 
08:39 AM	Samir Awan	What's the fine?
08:39 AM	Chris Sevs	My thought would be to start hiking before sunset and be back down well before sunrise and hopefully the permit check station won't be there at night. Though I heard they do post up on full moon weekends, but still it's a pretty hike even up to that check station
08:39 AM	Chris Sevs	Not a small amount of money 
08:43 AM	Chris Sevs	Eh maybe we just wait for the cables to come down at the end of the season. (womp)

10:16 AM	Peter Linnartz	HELP HELP
10:17 AM	Ross Wagner	Craigslist is a pretty good shop with great deals. Pat just got a dope (very light) city/road bike there 
10:17 AM	Ross Wagner	I liked huckleberry on market 
10:18 AM	Peter Linnartz	I want to stay somewhere there is a decent selection and knowledgeable people to talk to
10:18 AM	Peter Linnartz	Ok buying new or using the info I get to find something on CL
10:19 AM	Chris Sevs	http://www.bikesdirect.com/
10:19 AM	Chris Sevs	Crazy cheap deals
10:20 AM	Chris Sevs	Maybe go into a store, talk to someone about what you want (recommend a hybrid, a bit heavier but ideal for city travel and short rides and I stupidly use it for triathlons) and then go to the website to look up what you want after?
10:21 AM	Peter Linnartz	Makes sense
10:21 AM	Peter Linnartz	That website us pretty 1995
10:21 AM	Chris Sevs	That's how you know it's good
10:22 AM	Chris Sevs	Bill Clinton approved

11:38 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	$400 seems like a rip tho
11:39 AM	Peter Linnartz	Tommy that's not going to set me up for success given where I live...
11:42 AM	Chris Sevs	You need Mac's fist bike for the extra motivation to get up that hill
11:47 AM	Tommy Kuntze	If anyone can do it, it's you
12:14 PM	Peter Linnartz	(bike)(eggplant)
12:50 PM	Tommy Kuntze	Your big penis will get you up the hill? Seems counterintuitive...

08:18 AM	Chris Sevs	I think a single ticket will be in the $450 range or something like that
08:43 AM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Oh ok if that's 2 tix it's better... but still kinda wack for an event that's supposed to beyond money/transactions....

10:08 AM	Tommy Kuntze	Thanks @ReleaseTheAwesome !
10:39 AM	Chris Sevs	Just had a big counterintelligence meeting: Russia is going big on intelligence retrieval attempts!
10:39 AM	Chris Sevs	Well, not just Russia. Just a lot of big cyber attacks recently all over the damn place. 
10:39 AM	Chris Sevs	[Sticker]
10:40 AM	Chom	H4X0|R5
10:41 AM	Chom	*H4X0|25* my 1337 is rusty
10:42 AM	Chris Sevs	Get it together tom. Rookie mistake. 
10:43 AM	Chom	Well thanks to tor/ onion routing tracing h4x is really tough and comes down to assuming the tools in the breach used indicates the country /group the attack originated from which is frequently not the case
10:46 AM	Tommy Kuntze	(hacker)(evil)
11:04 AM	imaniani	I understood *cyber attacks* haha
11:05 AM	imaniani	Do you guys have any solid best-of articles or sources for ways to protect ourselves?
12:38 PM	Chom	"I don't have any sources in mind but can just tell you:

1. Exercise extreme precaution when clicking on links (especially attachments in emails). When in doubt, go directly to that company's website and login manually instead of following email links. Some links you can hover over with the mouse and it will show the true destination in the bottom left, alternately you can copy any hyperlink and paste into a notepad/word doc to make sure it's going to a legit site. 

2. No company should ask you in an email for either your bank account info or a password for any reason. It's a scam. 

3. Passwords. Make them long, and complex (numbers, uppercase, lowercase, special characters, at least 10 - characters). USE DIFFERENT PASSWORDS FOR BANKING AND EMAIL. Enable 2-step verification whenever possible. 

4. Use incognito mode, delete cookies / browsing history (you'll see less targeted ads and some sloppy cookies can actually be used to compromise your account)

5. If you're going to be engaging in ""risky"" online behavior (your work requires you to download potentially sketchy email attachments), use multiple anti-malware/ anti-virus applications. Be careful and do a little research tho, not all anti-virus programs play nice together and can often mistake each other as viruses. 
If you have to download something and are unsure if it contains a virus, download the file but DO NOT OPEN. After downloading, upload it www.virustotal.net to scan it for viruses/ malware. 

6. Back up your important files either online or to a USB hard drive regularly. 

7. Cover up your webcam with a sticky note. Yes the NSA/CIA/FSB/ random internet troll hackers have the ability to remotely turn on your webcam (including on your phones). They can't see anything if you've physically covered it. 

8. Ask a friend (like me) for advice

9. All the other things I forgot. "
12:44 PM	Chom	Also adblock plus is pretty cool: https://adblockplus.org
12:47 PM	Chom	Download the SeeFood app to know if you're eating a hotdog/ not hotdog
12:47 PM	Chom	https://streamable.com/hyppf
12:51 PM	Chom	Also I gave a bad link to virustotal whoops: www.virustotal.com
12:52 PM	Chom	Virustotal also scans URLs (websites) for viruses so you can copy paste a sketchy link there if you're not sure it has a virus
01:09 PM	imaniani	[Sticker]
01:10 PM	imaniani	Thanks Tom!! It feels like it's time to get next level on some security
01:14 PM	imaniani	[Sticker]
01:40 PM	Chom	Feel free to hit me up for specific questions/ recommendations 
01:49 PM	Tommy Kuntze	"Great list, Tom!

I'm a fan of these services:
1Password for creating and storing all of my complex passwords: https://1password.com/
It's like $100 but absolutely worth it.

Tunnelbear for browsing the web. It's a VPN and makes your browsing a little slower, but it's secure (and adorable): https://www.tunnelbear.com/"
01:51 PM	Chom	Great additions Tommy!
01:51 PM	Chom	[Sticker]
01:52 PM	Samir Awan	Ya ive wanted to try tunnel bear 
01:52 PM	Chom	Also for the slightly more technically minded Tor is free and relatively easy to configure. More users on tor ultimately means more nodes/security 
01:53 PM	Samir Awan	I'd be down to get some help setting up a tor 
01:53 PM	Samir Awan	I looked it up a few months ago bit never did it
01:54 PM	Chom	https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en
01:54 PM	Chom	I can walk you through it after work
01:54 PM	Samir Awan	It won't be today
01:55 PM	Samir Awan	Tom why don't you buy a climbing pass ?
02:26 PM	Chom	I'm going to, show me where 
02:56 PM	Jordan Schiff	Tor and tunnelbear also leads you to funtown

03:42 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	"One of our narcotics investigators came to the house looking for something else. When he knocked on the door, the guys said 'I guess you're here about the opium,'" the sheriff said.
03:46 PM	Samir Awan	Bahahh

12:14 AM	Jordan Schiff	There's a dj and dance floor
09:03 AM	Tommy Kuntze	"Looks promising (point)
UpCamp
https://appsto.re/us/-DJNib.i"
09:05 AM	Tommy Kuntze	When camping sites are booked for days you want to go, it notifies you if someone cancels and a spot becomes available (woot)
09:07 AM	Chris Sevs	Thank you tommy, I'm going to dig into this. There was a similar site that claimed to do this, but it didn't include NPS (the fuck?)
09:07 AM	Chris Sevs	But like... obviously the need for something like this exists 
09:11 AM	Chris Sevs	Hmmmm seems like it's only for three campgrounds in Yosemite. It's a start. 
09:13 AM	Chris Sevs	Ok so for each date range you want to watch, you pay a dollar. Regardless of if that range ever becomes available. 
09:14 AM	Samir Awan	Interesting business modrl
09:14 AM	Samir Awan	I thought they would make a little off the booking by charging a fee
09:16 AM	Chris Sevs	Right. I'm starting to wonder if they even help you book it vs just sending you to recreation.gov
09:26 AM	Tommy Kuntze	Oh bummer - I was totally sold on the concept but didn't dig too far. Thanks for getting I there dude.
09:27 AM	Chris Sevs	It seems like there is potential here, but it's a long ways from being really useful
09:27 AM	Chris Sevs	Nice job finding it though dude!
09:28 AM	Tommy Kuntze	Yeah looks like it just sends you to the website - more of a shortcut tool than a booking app
10:24 AM	Peter Linnartz	Anybody want to hike around Sierra in a couple months and help me find my ski?
10:25 AM	Peter Linnartz	It's Forest Service land so we can go whenever
10:28 AM	Matt Murphy	The parks service doesn't have APIs for booking campgrounds so they just funnel everyone to recreation.gov 🤦🏻‍♂️
10:28 AM	Matt Murphy	People could build some cool (shit) if they had some

07:32 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Just a few close-ups of Jupiter for y'all  on this lovely evening.
07:34 PM	Tommy Kuntze	[Sticker]
07:35 PM	imaniani	Aaaahh thank you! Jupiter is my soul planet!!
07:35 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Time-lapse images revealed them to be enormous cyclones, rotating counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere. The storms reached up to 1,400km wide, more than ten times the size of the largest cyclones on Earth. Deep inside the atmosphere, the scientists found evidence for what they called an “equatorial plume” – a massive and unexpected overturning of gas driven by a steady upward stream of ammonia from around the planet’s equator. It seems to mirror the Hadley cell convection currents on Earth, where warm air rises at the equator and falls again about 30 degrees to the north and south. 
07:35 PM	imaniani	Woah the face of it is like a fractal

04:14 PM	K-Pound	[Sticker]
04:21 PM	Chom	It's because if you live IN London the taxes on owning a car are so absurd that pretty much only the super rich can afford cars - generally the cheap cars you see are from ppl who live just outside London and commute in, even those ppl pay ridiculous 'VAT' tax 
04:28 PM	Jordan Schiff	They also pay absurd amounts for vanity plates
04:28 PM	Jordan Schiff	Upwards of 1 mil
04:41 PM	Chom	(stupid)(money)

09:13 AM	Natalie Marcisz	Still a mind boom (brain)
11:19 AM	Tommy Kuntze	Fake news
12:12 PM	ItsTheRealTony	What a surprise more fake news out of JYNA
12:12 PM	ItsTheRealTony	Probably some 400 lb dude in a bed somewhere 
12:16 PM	Chom	"This “quantum teleportation” doesn’t actually involve teleporting a real object—it’s not really teleportation at all. The scientists are actually sending information about a particle of light in a way that can only be accessed by two observers."
12:16 PM	Chom	It's a new form of encryption for quantum computing 
12:17 PM	Chris Sevs	Yeah it's just quantum entanglement, which is still interesting, but it's just information, not the actual photon
12:20 PM	Chom	Quantum entanglement is such an awesomely weird phenomenon. Two photons that have been entangled can be (theoretically) separated by light years but somehow still manage to "communicate" (for lack of a better word/understanding) instantaneously

Based on my EXTREMELY LIMITED knowledge, we can only entangle particles "locally", we'd still have to fly that entangled partner particle out to the distant star. There's no way to achieve entanglement remotely
03:13 PM	Chris Sevs	Not with THAT ATTITUDE
03:14 PM	Chom	No way to achieve entanglement as of TODAY*
03:15 PM	Chom	Ok go fix it Chris, create a mechanism by which we can remotely entangle particles so we stream hd video on the Europa 
04:01 PM	Tommy Kuntze	Easy - wormhole. (boom)

01:36 PM	Emily	Also - those of you who have medium, will you throw a heart my way on this article? It felt like a timely day to post it. It's important to me for personal and professional reasons to expand the conversation on depression and suicide

10:32 AM	Chris Sevs	Suuuuuuuuper sad news guys. The angel island on sept 30 camping thing is off

10:33 AM	Chom	"President Trump is considering pardoning himself. I asked 15 experts if that's legal. - Vox
https://apple.news/AtN7ODv1jQO-xx0a96tQGVg"
10:33 AM	Chris Sevs	I was going back into the details in the email so I could start organizing and in fine print said "for day use only, not for overnight stay"
10:34 AM	Chris Sevs	$300 for day use. What the hell does that even mean. Day use is just the cost of a fucking ferry ticket. 
10:34 AM	Jordan Schiff	Let's day party 
10:34 AM	Jordan Schiff	Slip n slide?
10:34 AM	Emily	Well my friends boat might be an option for sleeping there
10:34 AM	Emily	But there's limited room

10:35 AM	#patwilliams	And down for the slip and slide
10:35 AM	Chom	Dibs boat
10:36 AM	Chom	Are there any other "local" camping options?
10:36 AM	Emily	I'll ask him if that weekend is an option, and how many people could sleep on it
10:37 AM	Chris Sevs	I cancelled the "day use" thing because why pay $300 when the island is free during the day anyway??? WHAT EVEN IS THIS COST????
10:38 AM	Chris Sevs	The day use info wasn't even in the email. I had to go back to the IMPECCABLY DESIGNED reserve America website and check the details and then did a double take when I saw date of arrival and departure both as sept 30
10:40 AM	Chom	Yeah that's fucked
10:40 AM	Natalie Marcisz	U get to use the grill for $300

09:13 AM	Chris Sevs	Mike pence is actively making my life worse (well kinda)
09:13 AM	Chris Sevs	About a month ago he was visiting a facility that makes hardware for Orion
09:13 AM	Samir Awan	Huh
09:14 AM	Jordan Schiff	Did he touch the thing
09:14 AM	Chris Sevs	Orion is the Lockheed space program that will bring people to mars
09:14 AM	Jordan Schiff	That said don't touch??
09:14 AM	Chris Sevs	[Photo]
09:14 AM	Chris Sevs	MY GROUO HAD TO WRITE A WAIVER ON THE HARDWARE
09:14 AM	Chris Sevs	Group*
09:14 AM	Jordan Schiff	Dude he said Rubio dared him to do it
09:14 AM	Samir Awan	What is a waiver ?
09:15 AM	Chris Sevs	A formal document saying that there was an issue with hardware, and what the corrective action is to make it flight-worthy again 
09:15 AM	Chris Sevs	The language in it is absolutely amazing
09:16 AM	Chris Sevs	Including phrases like "one of our high profile visitors placed unprotected hand" and "inadvertently contaminated"
09:17 AM	Jordan Schiff	Pence is a contamination
09:19 AM	Chris Sevs	Hahaha now we have to go decontaminate it
09:19 AM	Chris Sevs	Reading this waiver is actually hysterical. It's so formal and tries to excuse a Vice President from not reading a sign hahahah
10:08 AM	Dhwani	Why would have happened if he had sneezed on it?
10:08 AM	Dhwani	*what
10:10 AM	Chris Sevs	[Photo]

10:13 AM	Natalie Marcisz	So space equipment needs to be sterile?
10:16 AM	Chris Sevs	Yeah for sure. And if I get that "space protector" job at NASA, I am going to CRACK DOWN on shit like this
10:17 AM	Chris Sevs	Can't send microbes into space and contaminate other worlds (well, we try not to)
10:36 AM	Chom	Yeah no matter how hard we try tho we always have these tiny stowaways hitching a ride on our rockets that surprisingly can survive the vacuum of space as well as the fiery hell known as re-entry 
11:28 AM	Chris Sevs	In other space news, check out this awesome Cassini photo taken of saturn's rings and moon Prometheus

07:21 PM	Jordan Schiff	Make sure it's overflowing so it burns him when he punts it into oblivion
07:21 PM	Samir Awan	Me too ...
07:21 PM	Jordan Schiff	Lol
07:24 PM	Peter Linnartz	You too? You're the one punting it
07:57 PM	Dhwani	I'm also working the (icecream) (taco)(truck) (with Thor).  We'll both be at OSL Friday!
08:04 PM	Natalie Marcisz	I don't think lattes punt very cleanly Peter
08:04 PM	Natalie Marcisz	But why are we punting them
08:05 PM	Jordan Schiff	Peter rocketed a latte he bought from us at the taco truck last yr. About 5 seconds after it was handed to him

08:09 PM	Samir Awan	Ya wtf peter
08:09 PM	Ross Wagner	One time I ordered a Gyro in Santa Cruz, and peter asked if he could have a bite. And then he stuffed over 60% of it in his mouth 
08:09 PM	Ross Wagner	In one bite 
08:12 PM	Peter Linnartz	I'm a man of my word
08:12 PM	Peter Linnartz	Samir didn't ask if he could punt a bite of my latte
08:13 PM	Samir Awan	Why would I do that ?
08:13 PM	Jordan Schiff	Guys.....it was samir
08:13 PM	Jordan Schiff	But I could see the peter had taken mind control over him
08:15 PM	Samir Awan	Fake news 
08:15 PM	Peter Linnartz	I had lost control of my own mind at that point
09:46 PM	imaniani	[Sticker]

Should your invention be selected, not only will you receive enough resources to cover roughly 325 square meters of dirt, but you'll be joining a community.

03:24 PM	Natalie Marcisz	Too specific
03:24 PM	Chris Sevs	It's a hot commodity 
03:24 PM	Sam Williams	The name-change was to just reflect his market shift to caffeine.

11:42 AM	Emily	Hey all - does anyone know enough about bitcoin to give me a quick run down sometime?
11:42 AM	Emily	[Sticker]
11:43 AM	Samir Awan	You'll need to know about block chain as well 
11:45 AM	Emily	[Sticker]
11:46 AM	Samir Awan	I can give you a very high level overview but I bet the tech bros here know more 
11:46 AM	Jordan Schiff	Been fuxin with btc since silk road 1
11:51 AM	Samir Awan	So Jordan knows a bunch 
11:52 AM	Ross Wagner	Never did bitcoin. Only ether and ripple
11:53 AM	Jordan Schiff	Yeah ether is good or litecoin which is way less volatile
11:54 AM	Emily	I have a client who wants to pay me in bitcoin - I'm trying to figure out if I should accept or not, but I know literally nothing about it
11:55 AM	Samir Awan	How much of a Bitcoin ?
11:55 AM	Jordan Schiff	Ehh it changes so much all the time
11:55 AM	Jordan Schiff	That I wouldn't recommend
11:56 AM	Emily	Ok, that's solid advice. I thought it'd be a fun way to try it out but I don't know if I'm savvy enough to stay on top of it
11:56 AM	Jordan Schiff	And transition fees are very high so to move it to usd will cost you
11:56 AM	Ross Wagner	I would advise to not do it - it doesn't have much of an audit trail like venmo or PayPal 
11:56 AM	#patwilliams	You would need to with draw immediately to get its current equivalent in dollars  
11:57 AM	Emily	But maybe I'd end up making more right?
11:57 AM	K-Pound	Might also cause tax confusion 
11:57 AM	Ross Wagner	You could - or you could lose your original value. It's a risk
11:57 AM	#patwilliams	Maybe! Maybe also less it fluctuates a lot  
11:57 AM	#patwilliams	Per day 
11:58 AM	Emily	Interesting. Ok cool. Sounds like until I inform myself I should prob say no 
11:58 AM	Emily	Thanks crew, love yalls mind power
12:54 PM	Tiago Bandeira	I would say no
12:55 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Fluctuates too much in value
12:55 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Why's he trying to do that?
01:53 PM	Emily	Long story why - but I think you're right that I should prob decline
03:01 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Also it's complicated to exchange. Would be easier to accept Chinese yen for instance
03:01 PM	Tiago Bandeira	👍
03:02 PM	#patwilliams	Yea as for yen instead.

Wed, 09/13/2017
02:23 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Hey y'all- just a reminder to always lock your doors and windows, even if you're home. I was working from tom's this morning and got burglarized. Heard something in the other room, saw a thug holding tom's laptop, chased him out into the hall and he dropped all our stuff (my purse, tom's laptops etc) and looked like he was pulling out a weapon so I ran back into the apt and locked the door. I'm safe and we have all our belongings still thank god but it was scary as fuck!
02:24 PM	Samir Awan	Omg that terrifying ! Are you ok? 
02:24 PM	Samir Awan	Did you call the cops?
02:24 PM	Emily	Holy shit dude!! Are you ok?? Like emotionally? That must have been terrifying! 
02:26 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	I'm ok. Was rattled for sure, but actually felt a lot better when i went back into the hall an hour later and saw he left my purse behind. Otherwise I'd have to re-key my whole apt building (cuz my ID and keys were in there), go to the DMV for a new license, yadda yadda.
02:27 PM	Samir Awan	Did you file a police report , Tom's apartment has cameras ya? I remember him showing me a nest once 
02:27 PM	Emily	Omg so glad you're ok <3
02:27 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Turns out they're fake cameras....
02:28 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	His building sucks balls. He called management and they're gonna lock that shit down cuz they guy prolly went up the fire escape. I called the cops but they never showed up. Not sure when it's too late to file a report....
02:28 PM	#patwilliams	Never too late 
02:28 PM	Samir Awan	Never too late 
02:29 PM	Samir Awan	Glad you are safe though 
02:29 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	My first mistake was calling a non-emergency line like 30 mins later. I called my bank first cuz I thought he had my purse and I figured it wasn't an emergency. But now I realize if I called 911 right away, they could've seen him running and intercepted him. U never know how you'll react in the moment.
02:30 PM	#patwilliams	Glad you’re safe although
02:30 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Thanks for the warm vibes y'all! Relieved I scared him away. Guess white bitches can be scary after all!
02:32 PM	Tiago Bandeira	You can still call 911 to report I think
02:32 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Or ask
02:32 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Glad you're safe
02:32 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Holy fuck that's crazy
02:32 PM	#patwilliams	Yea details are key. He might be doing this all over 
02:33 PM	Tiago Bandeira	I would keep calling until they send someone
02:33 PM	Tiago Bandeira	That's what out taxes go to
02:33 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Our*
02:33 PM	Samir Awan	Never know they could dust and there person has a record

02:36 PM	Rebs	Dusting does seem like it would be good!!
02:36 PM	Rebs	A break in like that is well worth a police visit!!
02:39 PM	Tommy Kuntze	So thankful you're okay Laura!

02:59 PM	Dhwani	So scary Laura!  Glad you're ok!

03:08 PM	Chris Sevs	Just reading these, sorry I'm late to the game. So glad that turned out with everyone being safe. Your naturally badassery was the savior!
03:26 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Haha I guess so! Lol. After I cooled down, I ended up feeling really sad for the guy. So much poverty and desperation amongst all the tech wealth 😔 
03:27 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	But yes, we should def follow up with a police report. I'm sure his prints are all over the laptops and door knobs and whatnot. Gah. Stay safe out there y'all!
03:28 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Side note: anyone wanna join me at Justin Martin tomorrow night? Tom can't come cuz he just started his new job and shouldn't be staying out late on a work night, so I have an extra ticket. Fo free!
03:29 PM	Samir Awan	I wish I could go 
05:03 PM	Chom	So I'm in the market for a new apartment 😅

05:36 PM	K-Pound	I didn't get all of these til all seemed amended on your side Laura. I'm SO GLAD YOURE OKAY, holy shit, that's so scary. I hope you do get that police report filed. The more that are filed in an area, the more police will patrol that area. That's one thing I learned living in the Haight, aka, where Tom is drawn to go next? No where is safe! Lock yo doors!!! 
05:37 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Seriously!! And lock yo fire escapes! And tell ur building managers to get REAL cameras! For fucks sake!
05:58 PM	Ross Wagner	Holy cow. Insane - glad you are doing fine Laura. Must be traumatizing and feel super violating to potentially get robbed. We got another bedroom if y'all want to chill out over the hill 
06:07 PM	Chom	Laura!! Call me, Oakland PD are here, they have a suspect matching the description in custody, need you to identify!!
06:13 PM	Ross Wagner	Get him!

06:35 PM	Chom	We'll never know, laura never got back to me and now they have to release him 
06:35 PM	ItsTheRealTony	Gah! So dramatic!
06:35 PM	Ross Wagner	Take a pic of that dude? And get his info and all 
06:36 PM	Ross Wagner	Can they not do that? That's an insane scenario
06:39 PM	Rebs	Yeah seriously!!!!
06:40 PM	Chom	Btw the suspect who's now been released is a crackhead with a history of..... you guessed it! Burglary
06:42 PM	Samir Awan	Laura !!!
06:45 PM	Chom	They have all his information, fingerprint ppl are coming tomorrow to dust for prints, if the prints match the best they can do is put a warrant out
06:47 PM	K-Pound	Damn that sucks!
07:35 PM	Tiago Bandeira	No!!
07:35 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Ahh shucks
07:41 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	My phone was in the other room. Gah! There are prints everywhere so hopefully that works.
07:42 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Not sure I would've done much over the phone. Would I FaceTime with the cops or something? Doesn't seem legally sound.

04:06 PM	Sam Williams	No. You'd be our guests. Just give me a heads up when you arrive so I can get you in
04:12 PM	Ross Wagner	If y'all haven't seen @Sam Williams general mansion in the presidio - this is a solid opportunity to do that! Also, sofar sounds is pretty sweet, cities around the US have people host live music shows at their homes. I have a friend who organizes the Dallas chapter

04:41 PM	Natalie Marcisz	What's the vibe Tony?
04:49 PM	ItsTheRealTony	Gonna be awesome
04:49 PM	ItsTheRealTony	So many trees and great places for homeless people to sleep!
04:50 PM	ItsTheRealTony	But seriously it's gonna be a pretty dope $1.5 Billion bus stop
04:51 PM	Peter Linnartz	No homeless sleeping allowed
04:51 PM	Peter Linnartz	It's a public private space
05:01 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Is that true?
05:01 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Who's paying for it?
05:02 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Why 1.5 billion dollars? Could we have built another subway instead?
05:06 PM	Ross Wagner	The idea of an elevated park is what sparked a lot of interest back in the day when they were coming up with the idea for it @Tiago Bandeira. Underground heavy civil under landfill land like SOMA actually probably would've surpassed 1.5 Bil dollars. Also, they needed a bus depot in that region badly
05:07 PM	Ross Wagner	They saw the success with the high line in New York and that other one in Netherlands and liked the idea of raised greenery
05:07 PM	imaniani	Tiago I believe you are paying for it
05:07 PM	imaniani	It also has a hole in it for high speed rail when/if that ever happens
05:08 PM	imaniani	It's San Francisco redevelopment $ that is taxpayer money right tony? It survived as a project when redev was dissolved 
05:10 PM	imaniani	The transbay tower (now known as sales force tower) is all part of it too
05:11 PM	Tiago Bandeira	Ahh got it! Thanks guys!

05:47 PM	Jordan Schiff	 He literally has some kind of issue with being empathetic....its very scary
05:53 PM	ItsTheRealTony	It’s called being a dirty old racist
05:53 PM	ItsTheRealTony	*dotty
05:53 PM	ItsTheRealTony	He hates brown people 
05:54 PM	ItsTheRealTony	Even if they are Americans maybe more so because they are American unfortunelty . 
06:02 PM	Emily	There is an actual law forbidding me as a psychologist from diagnosing him, but let's just say he is definitely not well
06:14 PM	Emily	And also he's a dirty old racist 
06:37 PM	Samir Awan	Wasnt there a video of him throwing out paper towels at some aid station?
06:45 PM	Samir Awan	http://time.com/4968074/donald-trump-paper-towels-puerto-rico/
06:57 PM	Tommy Kuntze	He’s really overestimating their absorbency
07:49 PM	ReleaseTheAwesome	Remember when he did a Muslim ban and wants to build a wall cuz he hates browns? Yet some whitey kills/injures 600 ppl and he sends his well wishes. What. The. Actual. Fuck.
08:31 PM	imaniani	Emily how bout you tell one of us and we'll shout it from the mountain tops. Though it does seem patently obvious that there's something very wrong.
08:32 PM	imaniani	To me he just seems very scared. Of a lot.

12:54 PM	Samir Awan	He knows what he did 
12:54 PM	Chris Sevs	Samir got booted from the other (line) for talking about blade runner in a strictly climbing-related setting
12:56 PM	Samir Awan	And everyone stood by and watched made them all accomplices 
12:57 PM	Chris Sevs	While it was obviously a (line) faux pas, perhaps booting him was an aggressive response
12:58 PM	Samir Awan	Haha is there a line 10 commandments I missed ?
12:59 PM	Chom	Yeah it’s in the book of unwritten rules 
01:00 PM	Samir Awan	Hmm kicked out of a line chat I started on Columbus day ... I see history repeats itself 
01:00 PM	Chris Sevs	We’re in the middle of writing it in the other line that you are no longer part of. We’ll let you know how it goes. 
01:02 PM	Chris Sevs	It definitely made for a pretty great moment

12:47 PM	Chris Sevs	If you use the Eiffel Tower record of the guy who climbed 71 times in 12 hours as a baseline rate of 3594 ft/hour, it would take 40 years to climb stairs to the top of the moon, no sleeping or resting
